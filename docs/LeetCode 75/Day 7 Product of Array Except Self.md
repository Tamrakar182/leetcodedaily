# 238. Product of Array Except Self

Tags: #array #prefixsum #medium

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is equal to the product of all the elements of_ `nums` _except_ `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

***You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.***

```Example
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

### My approach
```Python
```


### Personal Thoughts
This question was quite hard, not due to the problem statement but due to the restriction of both O(n) time complexity and no division operation.
