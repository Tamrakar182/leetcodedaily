# LeetCode Daily

This is my blog/website which contains my daily progress of LeetCode problems. I will be solving one leetcode problem everyday from [this](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/?fbclid=IwAR2kMaXgEN6U9xL2uorN1S6WynOcS4QvVCf0_uVm1L1lSpUAnb5qVFu_gVo) challenge set to hone my coding logic skills.

I have published my solutions in this repository. Feel free to fork and contribute to this repository.
You can also check out my [leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/Tamrakar182/) to see my submissions. My solutions are published on this [website](https://tamrakar182.github.io/leetcodedaily/) as well, with some insights on how I solved them.

## How this was made
I made this website by first writing the notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and used [this template](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs) to publish my Obsidian notes using Github Pages. The steps in order to deploy your own Obsidian notes using Github Pages are in the repository itself.
